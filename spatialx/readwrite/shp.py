    Parameters
    ----------

    path: string
        Path to the shapfile to import

    projection: string (optional)
        Map projection to use for the graph. If none is indicated, the positions
        are kept as they are in the shapefile (leave None if shapefile is
        already projected, for instance). Refer to the pyproj documentation for
        a list of possible projections.

    Returns
    -------

    G: SpatialX graph
        Spatial network, nodes have positions and edges have a length.
