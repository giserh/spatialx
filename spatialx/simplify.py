"""simplify.py

Algorithms to simplify spatial networks. Indeed, many networks contains many
degree 2 nodes which are topologically redondant, but are needed to respect the
geometry. Most of the time, these nodes are not necessary for the measures we
perform---we usually only needs the distance between degree != 2 nodes--- and
only make the computation slower. 

Simplifying the network allows for substantial performance improvement, even
when including the simplification/restitution process (linear in the number of
nodes).

def simplify(G):
    ''' Returns a simplified version of the graph comprising
            * The stations
            * The nodes with degree > 2
            * The nodes with degree 1
    Linked by edges whose length is equal to the sum of the lengths of the edges they replace.
    The simplified graph is topologically equivalent (same loops, edge weights) but lighter and makes
    computations easier.
