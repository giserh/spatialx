# SpatialX

Library (based on NetworkX) to analyse spatial networks. Please contribute!

## Beware!

This code does not have any test suite (yet!). Please consider the results of
the algorithms with extreme care, or better, help us by writing tests!

## Use

import spatialx as sx 


## Features

### I/O

+ Import Line shapefiles into a spatial network

### Statistics of paths

#### Centralities

+ Betweenness centrality
    + Usual betweenness centrality (nodes and edges)
    + Generalized betweenness centrality (nodes and edges)

+ Random walk centrality (nodes and edges)

+ Greedy Navigator Centrality (nodes and edges)

#### Paths


### Faces and dual network

+ Extraction of faces

+ Extraction of dual networkx

### Information representation


### Other features

+ Simplification of spatial networks to speed up calculations
